# Brown Hat: Courses, Certification Alignment & Official Exam Objectives

This document lists **all Brown Hat courses (levels)**, their **certification alignments**, and **official exam objectives/domains** for each cert. Use it to ensure course content aligns with what students need to pass the real exams.

---

## Part 1: How This Material Was Obtained (Reliability)

- **Source:** Official vendor exam outlines, objectives PDFs, and exam guides (CompTIA, ISC², ISACA, Microsoft, AWS, Open Group).
- **Method:** Web search for current exam codes and domain/objective lists; results cross-checked with vendor URLs (e.g. comptia.org, isc2.org, learn.microsoft.com, aws.amazon.com).
- **Your action for 100% reliability:** For each cert below, **download the latest official Exam Objectives / Exam Outline PDF** from the vendor’s certification page. Use that PDF as the single source of truth; this doc is a structured summary and checklist.
- **Updates:** Vendors change exam codes and weights (e.g. A+ 220-1101/1102 → newer; Security+ SY0-601 → SY0-701). Re-check vendor sites periodically and refresh this reference.

## Part 4: How to Use This for Content Creation

1. **Per course (level):** Take only the certs in the table in Part 2 for that level.
2. **Per cert:** Open the official objectives/outline PDF or link above; list every domain and (where available) every objective/sub-objective.
3. **Coverage matrix:** Create a table: rows = objectives (or domains), columns = “Module,” “Lesson(s),” “Quiz items,” “Done.” Ensure 100% coverage.
4. **Lesson content:** For each objective, create at least one lesson (concept/demo/lab) and, where appropriate, scenario-style quiz questions that match the objective’s wording (e.g. “Given a scenario…”).
5. **End-of-course:** Add an “Exam readiness” module (practice questions, exam tips) so “end of course” clearly means “equipped to sit the relevant certification.”

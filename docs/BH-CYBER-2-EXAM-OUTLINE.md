## Gap Analysis (Before Expansion)

- **Domain 5 (20% of exam):** Only lightly mentioned in “Security Architecture and Resilience”. **Addressed:** New Module 4 with two lessons on policies, compliance, awareness, and third-party risk.
- **Domain 2 depth:** CVE/CVSS and prioritisation were not a dedicated lesson. **Addressed:** New lesson “Vulnerability Types and Prioritisation”.
- **Domain 1 depth:** Cryptography in practice (TLS, certs) was brief. **Addressed:** New lesson “Cryptography in Practice”.
- **Domain 4 depth:** Secure deployment and hardening were not explicit. **Addressed:** New lesson “Secure Deployment and Hardening”.

## Coverage Summary

After expansion, BH-CYBER-2 has **4 modules** and **11 lessons**, with each of the five Security+ domains represented by at least one dedicated lesson and ISC² CC domains woven in where they align. Use the seed file and this outline to maintain alignment when exam objectives change.

# Lesson Content Standard

All lesson **content_markdown** must follow this structure. Certification names and exam references belong only in the **Exam alignment** section or in the database field `exam_alignment`, not in the lesson body.

## Required structure

1. **Title** (H1) — Lesson title.
2. **Introduction** (H2) — 2–4 sentences: what this lesson covers and what the learner should expect. No cert names.
3. **Objectives** (H2) — "By the end of this lesson you will be able to:" followed by a bullet list of 3–5 measurable outcomes.
4. **Main content** (H2 sections as needed) — Pure lesson content. No phrases like "Security+ domain X", "ISC² CC aligns", "CySA+ covers this". Define terms, explain concepts, give examples.
5. **Key takeaway** (H2) — One short paragraph summarising the main point.
6. **Exam alignment** (H2) — One line only: exam and objective references (e.g. "Security+ 1.1–1.2; ISC² CC Security Principles"). Used for display and backfill; no narrative.

## Rules

- **No certification names or exam references in the introduction, objectives, or main content.** Keep the body certification-agnostic so it reads as pure learning material.
- Content must be **substantial** and **exam-ready**: definitions, examples, and clear explanations so a student can use it to pass the aligned certification.
- Specialisation tracks (SOC, IAM, Cloud, GRC) must have **full curricula** with the same structure, not placeholders.
